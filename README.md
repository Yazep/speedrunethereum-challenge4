# DEX Challenge Solution

I've completed üö© **Challenge 4: Build a DEX** as part of my blockchain development journey with SpeedRunEthereum. This challenge was an invaluable learning experience, guiding me through the process of creating a simple decentralized exchange (DEX) for a token pair (ERC20 BALLOONS ($BAL) and ETH).

![DEX Challenge](https://github.com/scaffold-eth/se-2-challenges/assets/55535804/a4807ee8-555a-4466-8216-0d91e0e76c33)

## Key Learnings

- **Smart Contract Development**: Gained hands-on experience in developing smart contracts for a DEX, utilizing Solidity and the Hardhat environment.
- **ERC20 and Liquidity Pools**: Deepened my understanding of ERC20 tokens, liquidity pools, and the mechanisms behind automated market makers (AMMs).
- **Frontend Integration**: Learned to integrate smart contracts with a React frontend, allowing users to interact with the DEX seamlessly.

## Challenge Overview

- **Smart Contracts**: Developed two main smart contracts, `Balloons.sol` for the ERC20 token and `DEX.sol` for the decentralized exchange logic.
- **Liquidity Provision and Swapping**: Implemented functionality to allow users to provide liquidity in both ETH and $BAL tokens and to swap between these assets based on a price formula.
- **Deployment and Testing**: Deployed the smart contracts to a testnet and built a user-friendly frontend for the DEX, enabling real-world testing and interaction.

## Deployment

The final deliverable is a fully functional DEX app that enables users to trade $BAL tokens with ETH directly from their wallets. The project was deployed to a testnet, making it accessible for public interaction and testing.

## Conclusion

Completing this challenge has significantly enhanced my skills in Ethereum smart contract development and DEX mechanics. It was a challenging yet rewarding experience that has prepared me for more complex blockchain development projects in the future.
